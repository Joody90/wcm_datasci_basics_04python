# Assignment 5

You will once again fork this repository to your own Github account, make a branch named submission, and submit the assignment by merging the submission branch and assigning `axiezai@gmail.com` as the reviewer. The assignment will be reviewed via Github. 

Make sure you are using the appropriate `conda` environment when working on a Python project (this assignment). And `deactivate` your Python environment once you are done using Python. 

## Part 1

Using the same tamagotchi pet script we created during class, do the following (I expect you to make appropriate commits based on added functionality):

 1. Add a happiness meter that decreases over time at half the rate of hunger's rate. 

 2. Add a pet action, when you pet your tamagotchi pet, the happiness will increase. How happy your pet gets is up to you. 

 3. Modify the feed action, so that when you feed you pet, both hunger and happiness will increase. But your pet should receive less happiness from feeding than petting. 


## Part 2

Complete the exercises in the jupyter notebook `p-values.ipynb`. Remember you can start a jupyter work session with `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook` in your terminal. Use the correct Python environment!
